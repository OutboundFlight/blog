# Rocket Blog

Portland State Aerospace Society is a student aerospace engineering project at
Portland State University. We're building ultra-low-cost, open source rockets
that feature some of the most sophisticated amateur rocket avionics systems
in the world.

Meetings take place almost every
[Tuesday at 7pm at PSU](http://psas.pdx.edu/Schedule/). Come join us anytime!

Check back here or [add this blog to your RSS reader](/feed.xml) for updates
about the group. You can also
[follow us on twitter](https://twitter.com/pdxaerospace),
